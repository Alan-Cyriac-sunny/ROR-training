# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars', character: 'Luke' },
#                        { name: 'Lord of the Rings', character: 'Frodo' }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
